# Applying Message Brokering & Event-Driven Architecture on Azure

## Abstract

The most fun part with any cloud architecture styles is seeing it in action. In this session, I'll demonstrate how we can design and implement event-driven applications on the cloud. We'll look into several building blocks, from using event modeling to communicate our specification, to implementing in-process messaging in .Net Core with the mediator pattern, and finally using Queues & Event Grid on Azure to wire things together and complete our story.
