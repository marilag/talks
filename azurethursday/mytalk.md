# Applying Message Brokering & Event-Driven Architecture on Azure

## Abstract

The most fun part with any cloud architecture styles is seeing it in action. In this session, I'll demonstrate how we can design and implement event-driven applications on the cloud. We'll look into several building blocks, from using event modeling to communicate our specification, to implementing in-process messaging in .Net Core with the mediator pattern, and finally using Queues & Event Grid on Azure to wire things together and complete our story. 


## Outline

- Game - The gossip game
  
- Introduction to Message Brokering Pattern
  - Distributed Dungeon
    - Coordination
    - Decoupling 
    - Load balancing    
    - Resilience
  
  - What's Event-Driven 
  
  - Message vs Events 1 min
    - Commands - high value messages
    - Msg: Producer > Consumer
    - Msg: Producer > Multiple Consumers
    - Events: Producer > Multiple subscribers    

  
- Choosing the right Azure service for messaging 
  - Storage Queue
    - Problem: What if you need to accept large amount of requests
    - Use Case: Split a big paragraph and call the endpoint for each word
    - Solution: Azure storage queue 
    - Demo: Simple queue - demo
    - Take-away
      - Support larger messages, upto 80GB
      - Server logs 
      - At least once - handle indempotence on app as there is no built-in duplication check        
    - Notes: can use scheduling, ttl, supports poison queue
 
  - Service Bus
    - Problem: What if you need to quarantee the order of how the message is recieved
    - Use Case: Build the same paragraph
    - Solution: Service Bus - enteprise grade message broker system. Use pull - client polls  
    - Demo: FIFO on service bus
    
    - Problem: What if you need to send messages that are related to each other.
    - Use Case: All words must pass validation or the paragraph can't be created
    - Solution: Service Bus Transactions
    - Demo: Transactions 
    
    
    - Problem: What if you need several receivers of your message
    - Use Case: 2 different receivers must build the same paragraph
    - Solution: Service Bus Topics
    - Demo: Pub/Sub Service Bus   - 
    
    
    - Takeaway on Service Bus
      - Supports FIFO, Transactions and Pub/Sub
      - at most once (duplicate detection)     
      - 64 kb < 256 kb and 80 GB  
      - No server logs
  
    
  
- Choosing the right Azure service for events
  - What about events
  - Event Grid
    - Problem: What if you just want to notify another system that something happened in your system
    - Use Case: Once I created a paragraph, I need to let the audience know that the story is ready
    - Solution: Event Grid - Serverless event borker. Uses push notification style - event grid calls the client's api
    - Demo: Push paragraph to event grid and store it as blob

      Take-Away
      - Push 
      - lowcost
      - at least once - demo
      - pub/sub multiple subscribers and subscriber will get all existing events?
    
  - Event Hub - no demo just mention the use case for large amount of events e.g Logs, IoT
  

Thinkg about 5 Pillars of Architecture - Cost, Performance, Reliability, Security, Operational 
  - table of pricing model, latency, availability, security
  
- How does messaging work with highly distirbuted platforms like serverless 
  - Durable function
  - Logic Apps
  - CosmosDB
  
- Tip: How do we do it?
  - Event Modeling  
  - In-process messaging 
    - Mediator pattern

- Thanks
